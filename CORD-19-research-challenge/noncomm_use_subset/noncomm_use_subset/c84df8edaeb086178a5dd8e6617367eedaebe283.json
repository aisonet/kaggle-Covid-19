Re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus H5N1 poses extra challenge to IV control. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated RNA interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect. Here, we designed several amiRNAs targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1, a major determinant of pathogenicity. Expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amiRNA with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68). One amiRNA, HA-1405, significantly limited H5N1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication. AdC68-conjugated HA-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of H5N1 plaque formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Moreover, prophylactic administration with rAd(HA-1405) markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3to 40-folds of lung viral RNA copies against four clades of H5N1 in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Our results further showed that rAd(HA-1405) conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 challenge, respectively. In conclusion, these data provided information that HA-targeting amiRNA delivered by AdC68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses (IV) widely spread among diverse hosts and lead to seasonal outbreaks annually, which cost millions of human lives and significant economic losses. 1 In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was firstly reported to transmit from poultry to human in Hong Kong. 2 Ever since then, this subtype continuously circulated in domestic and wild birds and sporadically caused human infections. Up to now, 844 cases from 16 countries have been documented in the World Health Organization with the fatality rate of ~53% (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) , among which 52 cases were confirmed in China (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/). Exposure to sick poultry was considered a major risk factor of H5N1 infection. 3 However, several episodes of potential human-to-human transmission raised more concerns about H5N1 pandemic. 4 Strain-matched vaccines are viewed as the best preventative strategy for IVs, whereas the development of H5N1 vaccines encounters extra obstacles than seasonal flu ones. 5 On one hand, H5N1 virus is lethal to chicken embryos, thus the yield of egg-dependent inactivated vaccines is largely restricted. On the other hand, operations with HPAI H5N1 have to be performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. Moreover, neutralizing antibody-based vaccines usually take several days before onset. Thus, novel egg-free avian IV vaccines that could take immediate effect could be an appropriate supplementary.",

Four amiRNAs which scored highest according to online RNAi designer (http://rnaidesigner.invitrogen. com/rnaiexpress/) were generated as described in the Materials and Methods, including HA-300, HA-903, HA-1229, and HA-1405. The pre-amiRNA sequences were displayed in Table 1 . To evaluate the inhibitory effect of the amiRNA constructs, we transfected the aforementioned amiRNA plasmids (1 \u03bcg) separately into HEK 293T cells 24 hours before influenza challenge. Transduced cells were infected with 0.0005 MOI H5N1 and lysed with Trizol for RNA isolation 24 hours later. Neg-miRNA control plasmid-treated cells were used as mock controls, and its flu gene expression level was set at 100%. As depicted in Figure 1 , all amiRNA treatments significantly lowered H5N1 viral production compared to corresponding controls (P < 0.01). Among four amiRNAs, HA-1405 exhibited strongest inhibition on clade 2.3.2 (mean viral load 3.30%) and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 (mean viral load 11.10%). Its mean suppression on clade 9 was 41.17%, only next to HA-903 (mean viral load 24.53%), while the latter one was less efficient against other three H5N1 clades. As to clade 7, all four amiRNAs showed similar effect (HA-300, 27.63%; HA-903, 25.20%; HA-1229, 33.00%; and HA-1405, 35.57%). Based on in vitro screen results, we chose HA-1405 to perform further experiments.",

Our previous data proved that adenovirus vector was one of the ideal candidates considering its tissue tropism and safety. 8, 10 Here, we inserted the whole amiRNA (HA-1405) expression cassette into the E1 region of AdC68 and rescued the recombinant adenovirus, termed as rAd(HA-1405). To examine whether rAd(HA-1405) could suppress H5N1 growth in vitro, we performed HAtargeting western blot in Vero cells and plaque reduction assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Figure 2 ). The expression of HA was significantly reduced in rAd(HA-1405) transduced Vero cells when infected with either clade of H5N1 virus. The inhibition efficiency exhibited a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2a) . It is noteworthy that HA expression in clade 2.3.2-infecting cells was nearly abolished in presence of 10 10 virus particle (vp) of rAd(HA-1405). Furthermore, the inhibition in influenza plaque formation was assessed in MDCK cells. As shown in Figure 2b -e, the numbers of plaques were all significantly lowered in the presence of 10 10 vp of rAd(HA-1405) against four clades of H5N1 challenge compared to corresponding controls (clade 2.3.2, P = 0.0024; clade 2.3.4, P = 0.0031; clade 7, P = 0.0060; and clade 9, P = 0.0023). Pretreatment of 10 9 vp rAd(HA-1405) slightly decreased the average plaque formation of four H5N1 strains, but no significant difference was detected comparing to corresponding controls . Neg-miRNA plasmid transfectants were used as the positive controls. Influenza matrix gene expression was measured by real-time PCR 24 hours postinfection in cell lysate and normalized to \u03b2-actin. Matrix expression level in control groups was designated to be 100%, and the relative Matrix gene level in treated groups was normalized to be a percentage of the control value. Data were shown as mean relative expression to control \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. ANOVA was applied to compare difference among groups. P < 0.01 in all IV-specific amiRNA transfectants when compared to positive controls. ANOVA, analysis of variance. (Figure 2c-e) .

In brief, indicated dose of plasmid was mixed with X-treme reagent at the ratio of 1:2 in Opti-MEM (Gbico, Grand Island, NY). The transfection complex was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and transferred directly into cells.

H5N1 hemagglutinin targeting artificial miRNAs were designed by Invitrogen's BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Designer (http:// rnaidesigner. invitrogen.com/rnaiexpress/). Four bestsuited single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed for double-stranded oligos, and further cloned into the miRNA expression vector pcDNA 6.2-GW/miR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Five mice from each group were sacrificed 5 dpi, and lung tissues were taken for virology and histology examination. Weight loss and survival rates of remaining mice were observed daily for 21 days. Mice in excess of 30% weight loss would be euthanized considering animal welfare. Viral load titration. Influenza virus RNA copies were determined by quantitative real-time PCR as previously reported, 27 which has been proved in good agreement with traditional titration methods with higher sensitivity. 28 Briefly, total RNA from treated cells was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocols. Purified RNA was dissolved in 100 \u03bcl diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water (Takara, Dalian, China). The concentration and quality was determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometrically (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE).
