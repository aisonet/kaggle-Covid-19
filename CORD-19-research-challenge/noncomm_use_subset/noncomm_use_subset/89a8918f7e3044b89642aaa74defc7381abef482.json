            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread throughout the country within 1 month. The pathogen of this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11, 2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease . To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has become a global threat. [1] [2] [3] [4] In addition, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice. 5 Prior to this, on January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern; therefore, this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response. Increased dissemination of information through use of the internet is associated with increased transmission of information from all geographical regions and 4 across disciplines regarding recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 6 ; nevertheless, important factors associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal treatment, remain uncertain. Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease (ARD), and pneumonia.",

First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier 19 state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high. [12] [13] [14] Subsequent to the publication of the studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased, children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports. 8, 11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear. 49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient population, were conducted in China, and the study of asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients; however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected in the nose than in the throat. 50 As there is a concern of virus spread due to severe cough 20 induced by performing a throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic patient. 49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating the ",

Initially,Li et al.  used the data on exposure among 10 confirmed cases in Wuhan to estimate the mean incubation period, which was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0); the 95 th percentile of the distribution was 12.5 days (95% CI, 9.2 to 18).20 One estimation based on 125 patients with clearly defined exposure periods in China indicated that the median incubation period was 4.75 (interquartile range: 3.0-7.2) days.15 Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside of Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, Backer et al. estimated that the mean incubation period was 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). 21 However, Guan et al., using a large sample for estimation, suggested that the median incubation period was only 3.0 days, but could be as long as 24 days.11 Overall, these 11 estimates will be refined as more data become available. Detailed epidemiological information based on a larger sample of patients infected with COVID-19 is needed to determine the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to determine whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period.Previous reports revealed that there are asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.7,8,22 These patients can spread the virus and may represent a population that can be easily neglected in epidemic prevention. Therefore, it is important to identify asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Since these patients are asymptomatic, careful monitoring of the natural course of the disease and contact history may only identify them. Based on the current data, we do not know whether these patients are only asymptomatic initially after contracting the disease or if they are asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.Among a pooled analysis of 970 patients with ARD(Table 1)based on two studies with detail clinical characteristics, 11,23 males comprised more than half of the patients and the mean age was 45 years.
