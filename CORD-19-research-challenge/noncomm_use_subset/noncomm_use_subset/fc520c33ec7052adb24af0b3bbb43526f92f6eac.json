Li, 34, was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital. On 30th December, 2019, when the Wuhan municipal health service sent out an alert, he reportedly warned a closed group of ex-medical school classmates on the WeChat social media site of \"Seven cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like illness with links with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market\" at his hospital. He was among eight people reprimanded by security officers for \"spreading rumours\". In a tragic turn of events, he subsequently contracted SARS-CoV-2 and, after a period in intensive care, died on the morning of Friday 7th February, 2020 (South China Morning Post, 2020).",

ProMED posted the initial report of the unknown pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan on 30 February 2020. This was not a real increase, but reflected the addition of the cumulative number of clinically diagnosed cases (without laboratory confirmation) to the reported number of laboratory confirmed cases and demonstrates how easily a case definition can influence numbers. On 19 February 2020, the Chinese authorities changed the case definition to include laboratory confirmed cases only and designating clinically diagnosed cases as suspected cases. This resulted in a rapid drop of daily newly confirmed cases, again demonstrating the impact of case definition on reported case numbers. As of 23 February 2020, WHO has reported a total of 78,007 cases with 2,462 deaths globally with reports of cases from 29 countries (WHO, 2020a,b) .",

Multi-site collaborations such as the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Wilder-Smith and Boggild, 2018) can act as sentinel systems to recognize new patterns of disease in travelers from specific areas. Previous GeoSentinel data showed that despite receiving care at specialized post-travel medicine sites, up to 40% of returning ill travellers with febrile illness do not have a confirmed etiology; frequently no specific diagnostic testing is available to identify a cause (Freedman et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2007; Leder et al., 2013) . The current large-scale outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, highlights the critical importance of prioritizing the identification of disease etiology through clinician awareness and modern laboratory techniques such as NGS.",

Dr Li Wenliang's example as an astute clinician should inspire all of us to be vigilant, bold and courageous in reporting unusual clinical presentations. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak underscores the responsibilities and the vulnerabilities of frontline health care workers in tackling novel and highly transmissible pathogens. We must use our knowledge and skills, with the backup of laboratory support, to rapidly detect and report any suspicion of emerging infections. Rapid, transparent communication is paramount when infectious diseases emerge. This is the only way to prevent major outbreaks and will save many lives.",
